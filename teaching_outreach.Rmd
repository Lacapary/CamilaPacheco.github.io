### Outreach
* How will the climate be in Norway in 2100? 
We found that 82.5% of the mountain areas in Norway currently above the forest line will grow forest. This means fewer alpine areas (if the forest keeps pace with climate change, it will probably lag). This projection was base on the RCP 4.5 pathway for the period 2071-2100.

### Data Visualization
**Contributions to #TidyTuesday**

* #TidyTuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem and the `{tidyverse}` package bundle to wrangle, explore and visualize the data set that is provided by the [R4DS Online Learning Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/).

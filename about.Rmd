I am global change ecologist and  biogeographer, currently doing a PhD in Global Change Ecology, in the [EECRG](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG) group at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/bio).  
As a computational ecology, I apply analytical and mechanistic modeling approaches to better understand the processes shaping the distribution of biodiversity across space and time.  
Most of my work has dealt with the Neo-tropics, but I also have experience in Alpine and Mediterranean ecosystems.  

I am passionate about data visualization and communicating science to a broader audience and talks about wilds life conservation.  

My research activity is structured around five main lines:  

  * Biogeography
  * Spatial modeling (GIS)
  * Range shift
  * Landscape ecology
  * Biodiversity conservatioN
  
## Education

My educational background is in ecology with an emphasis on community ecology and spatial modeling. I obtained a bachelor's degree in Ecology from [Pontifical Xavierian University](https://www.javeriana.edu.co/inicio), a Master’s degree in Ecology and Evolution from [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

## My Interests
  
  * Biogeography
  * Quantitative ecology
  * Modeling and simulation
  * R language
  * Data visualization
  * GIS
  * Photography
  * Digital illustration

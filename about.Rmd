I am a global change ecologist and biogeographer, currently doing a Ph.D. in Global Change Ecology in the [EECRG](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG) group at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/bio).  

Born and raised in Colombia, I grew up surrounded by diverse landscapes and ecosystems. Such life experiences encouraged a curiosity that pushed me to study ecology as a science. Unfortunately, I have also experienced close hand how climate change and human activities have become a risk for biodiversity. Influence by these, my academic goal is to understand the underlying patterns and processes contributing to biodiversity change. 

As a computational ecology, I apply analytical and mechanistic modeling approaches to understand the processes better shaping biodiversity's distribution across space and time.
Most of my work has dealt with the Neo-tropics, but I also have experience in Alpine and Mediterranean ecosystems.

I am passionate about data visualization and communicating science to a broader audience, and wilds life conservation.

My research activity is structured around five main lines:  

  * Biogeography
  * Spatial modeling (GIS)
  * Range shift
  * Landscape ecology
  * Biodiversity conservation
  
## Education

My educational background is in ecology with an emphasis on community ecology and spatial modeling. I obtained a bachelor's degree in Ecology from [Pontifical Xavierian University](https://www.javeriana.edu.co/inicio) and a Master’s degree in Ecology and Evolution from [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

  * Biogeography
  * Quantitative ecology
  * Modeling and simulation
  * R language
  * Data visualization
  * GIS
  * Photography
  * Digital illustration

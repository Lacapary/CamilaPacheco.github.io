I am global change ecologist and  biogeographer, currently doing a PhD in Ecology and Global Change, in the [EECRG](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG) group at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/bio).\
I have quite a bit of experience in applying state-of-the-art quantitative methods to better understand the processes shaping the distribution of biodiversity across space and time.
Most of my work has dealt with the Neo-tropics, but I also have experience in Alpine and Mediterranean ecosystems. \

I also supervise students and organize scientific events. 
I am passionate about communicating science to a broader audience and talks about wilds life conservation.


My research activity is structured around five main lines:\

  * Biogeography
  * Spatial modeling (GIS)
  * Range shift
  * Landscape ecology
  * Biodiversity conservation.
  
## Education

I obtained a BSc in Ecology from [Pontifical Xavierian University](https://www.javeriana.edu.co/inicio), a Master’s degree in Ecology and Evolution from [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

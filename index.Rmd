You have reached the personal webpage of Camila Pacheco-Riaño.
I am a global change ecologist and biogeographer currently studying biodiversity lag responses to climate change at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/bio). My research aims to determine the drivers of the complex patterns of biodiversity change over time around the world's mountains.

Here you can find information about some of my research interests and ongoing projects. [Read more about me...](about.html)

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or are interested in working together.
